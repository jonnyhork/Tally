# Tally


Anyone who has a social group of friends has probably found themselves in a drawn-out text message conversation, whether you're trying to make weekend plans or maybe finally settle on who has the best burger in town. Then, 30 min later, youâ€™re still on the couch waiting for a decision to be made instead of getting out and having fun. 

I was thinking it be nice if there was something you could use to easily check the pulse of the group, in one place, without leaving iMessage, to be the deciding factor once and for all.

So I decided to dive into a new language and build a native iOS application for iMessage, using Swift and Xcode, to do just that.

Your custom poll in a URL query string, then packaged up and placed right into your conversation so you can send it to anyone who has the app.
